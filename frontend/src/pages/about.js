            Team Fortress 2 Playground (TF2PG) was initially conceived as a spiritual successor to TF2Pickup, a popular web based pug system where players could easily participate in 6v6, Highlander, Ultiduo or BBall matches. Now defunct in addition to the rising popularity of sites such as TF2Center & PugChamp, no web application has truly managed to fill the void created by TF2Pickup. TF2Center tends to be more aimed and accessible towards newer players getting into Competitive TF2. PugChamp on the other hand, is more geared towards seasoned veterans due to the drafting system which can alienate mid level players. 
 
      
            Playground is inspired by many of the ideas from TF2Pickup, most importantly team randomization, to prevent team stacking. Players will add up to a class with no indication of who they will be playing with, in a similar vein to a doublemix allowing for closer games. Playground operates on a first come first serve basis, with no limitations on what skill level a player must be to join a class, skill level will only determine what players a user will be assigned with.
    
            A new addition unique to this PUG system is the addition of the map vote, which all users can participate in. This addition should hopefully incentivise users to join more lobbies, instead of waiting for a specific map to be available or only select users picking the map.Due to this sites development is primarily supported by one user only, Playground will only support one game mode (6v6) and only one lobby at a time. Due to financial/time constraints, this restriction may change in the future depending on the popularity of the website.
